1 bag of kale
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 tablespoon olive oil

Pre-heat a large skillet on medium. Add oil, then soon after add garlic. Heat the garlic for approximately 1 minute, stirring frequently. Mix in the kale and stir around so that all the kale has oil. Stir in the salt. Stir occasionally for approximately 6 minutes or until desired level of cook. Shorter period will result in chewier kale; longer period will be more crispy.
